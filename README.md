# ULTIMATE CAROUSEL

## To-Do

### - Adjust slide sizes on screen resize

### - Slides scrolled per click option

### - Possibly exclude options that are not relevant due to other options

### - Option to Fade In/Out instead of slide

### - Space between slides

## Errors

### - slider breaks when animationSpeed and autoSlideDelay are the same. What will happen if autoSlideDelay is less than animationSpeed?
