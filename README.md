# ULTIMATE CAROUSEL

## To-Do

### CRITICAL

### - Have desktop options override mobile defaults if manually set by user? If a mobile option is different than a desktop default, then mobile takes precedence?

### - ~include itemsPerSlide in the responsiveAdjustments~

### - HIGH level of mobile responsiveness

### - set minimum sliderSpace to 20 (for the sake of the mask)

### - Cross-browser compatibility

### - throw error if non existent option is entered

### - double check all options are being validated properly

### - double check all logical required options are being set

### - ~recode UC class two accept two sets of options, desktop and mobile~

### - FINAL THOROUGH TESTING & CLEANUP FOR FIRST STABLE BETA

### OPTIONAL

### - limit perimeter slide percentage shown to the width of the next slide

### - option to show a bit of the next/previous slide

### - responsiveAdjust between desktop and mobile options on screen resize (currently only works on load)

### - ADVANCED ADA compliance

### - Option to Fade In/Out instead of slide

### - Clickable indicators

### - Slides scrolled per click option

### - Complete Warning Handling

### - Lazy image loading option

### - Adaptive height option

### - ADVANCED Swipe to scroll on mobile
