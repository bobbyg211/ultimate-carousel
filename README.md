# ULTIMATE CAROUSEL

## ABOUT

This is a beta version of a carousel library built for the purposes of the [Enrollify website](https://www.enrollify.org/). While this library has been tested and is currently feature complete, bugs may still exist and more through testing and optimization is required. For the sake of time however, this has been moved to production.

Currently no documentation exists and while it was built with other users in mind, some stylistic elements are Enrollify specific and do not currently have the option of being updated. Additional features are already in progress and documentation will eventually be published alongside the official release of v1.0.0. Timeline yet to be determined.

Currently the only stable release is v.0.1.0-beta.
